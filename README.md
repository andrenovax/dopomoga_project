“Dopomoga” is a website, where people and companies that want to support charitable projects, and charities and people in need looking for resources, can do it easy and fast by:
- finding current projects, that gather or give resources;
- following specific criteria and getting info about new projects that match it;
- creating a project that gives or gathers resources and waiting for the “match” or messages from people and organizations, that want to help or receive help;
- communicating with project authors and other people that support it.

Unlike similar projects dopomoga provides a set of features that take all the pain of giving away, makes it spamless and effective:
1. broad privacy settings: projects giving resources (“project helper”) can be “matched” with the projects and seen only by users specified by author with his priorities (cause, location, specific charities or users).
2. antispam: projects gathering resources (“projects in need”) can be published only by verified charities.
3. notifications: when “match” between “project in need” and “project helper” criteria found, the project authors are notified about it, 
4. anonymous: messages and comments (if specified).
5. verification reviews.
6. communication tools: comments and messages.
7. info about people you support, not only projects.
8. info about the causes and resources: to let people make people's choice of what they support easier.
