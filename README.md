<strong>Live Demo: </strong>http://dopomoga.herokuapp.com/dopomoga/
<p>“Dopomoga” is a website, where people and companies that want to support charitable projects, and charities and people in need looking for resources, can do it easy and fast by:</p>
<ul>
<li> finding current projects, that gather or give resources;</li> 
<li> following specific criteria and getting info about new projects that match it;</li> 
<li> creating a project that gives or gathers resources and waiting for the “match” or messages from people and organizations, that want to help or receive help;</li> 
<li> communicating with project authors and other people that support it.</li> 
</ul>
Unlike similar projects dopomoga provides a set of features that take all the pain of giving away, makes it spamless and effective:
<ol list-style-type="decimal">
<li> broad privacy settings: projects giving resources (“project helper”) can be “matched” with the projects and seen only by users specified by author with his priorities (cause, location, specific charities or users).</li> 
<li> antispam: projects gathering resources (“projects in need”) can be published only by verified charities.</li> 
<li> notifications: when “match” between “project in need” and “project helper” criteria found, the project authors are notified about it.</li> 
<li> anonymous: messages and comments (if specified).</li> 
<li> verification reviews.</li> 
<li> communication tools: comments and messages.</li> 
<li> info about people you support, not only projects.</li> 
<li> info about the causes and resources: to let people make people's choice of what they support easier.</li> 
</ol>
